				Built by 100% volunteer power, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of this community, hosted by AIGA
				DC. AIGA Member On-Sale begins 9/5 at 10:00am and the General Public On-Sale begins 9/10 at 10:00am.
				100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the Design Continuum Fund
				(DCF) scholarship fund. We believe in fostering the next generation of designers through helping local
				design-minded and underrepresented students as they pursue their education.
