    > The creative community in DC is an ever-growing body of professionals, makers, and voices working across disciplines. Hosted and produced by AIGA DC, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of that community.

    ### <strong>DCDW2020: Your Creative Voices</strong>

    We get it. People around the country hear “DC” and they immediately imagine lobbyists on Capitol Hill and buttoned-up professionals with offices on K Street. But those of us who live here know we’re so much more than that.

    This year’s DC Design Week will challenge that misperception by elevating the creative energy that flows through the DMV. Your energy. We’re here to show the world that we — the people who call DC and the DMV home — are so much more diverse, vibrant, and innovative than anyone can imagine.

    > ### <strong>Commitment: Inclusion and Accessibility</strong>

    Beyond creativity and design, we are committed to inclusion and accessibility.

    We believe that DC Design Week should reflect the voices throughout the DMV. We want to ensure that you are not only heard by our organization but by the rest of our community. Why? To cultivate an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives and disciplines.

    We love connecting over shared experiences and learning from our differences. It’s kind of our thing.

    Here’s what we’re committed to:

    - Our program will feature diverse speakers who represent our city and region — and what our industry <em>should</em> be.

    - Our events will explore not just how design can fight racism and make the world more inclusive but how design has contributed to the inequitable world we live in. We will confront the past and take on the challenges needed to make progress.

    - As we go virtual, we will ensure that every event is accessible to everyone. No questions asked. We’ll be planning ahead, but don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to confirm details. We’re always available at [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org).
