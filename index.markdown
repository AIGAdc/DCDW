  body: 'DC’s been mixing, remixing, and adding a funkier beat since Chuck Brown kept
    his fans on the dance floors for hours in the 60s and 70s. In the 80s, the city
    used its showmobiles to provide up to four free go-go concerts a day all summer!

  body: 'Did you know you can make a bong out of that?! Arlington’s DEA Museum boasts
    an extensive collection of bongs, including one made out of a plastic honey bear
    and another from an imitation mayonnaise jar. You can’t accuse the DMV of not
    being creative!

  body: 'The best place for fresh seafood for the last 214 years has been the Maine
    Ave. Fish Market. The Fish Wharf is the oldest continuously operating fish market
    in the U.S. — older than the Fulton Fish Market. Take that, NYC!

  body: 'The Nine may be the last word, but if you want to settle things with a little
    three-on-three there’s an even higher court. Literally. On the top floor of the
    Supreme Court is the *[actual highest court](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highest-court-of-the-land){:target="_blank"
