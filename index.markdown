header-2:  DC and Design have a lot in common
copy-2: |
  We have more depth than the surface suggests. More engaged communities than most expect. More originality than anyone thought possible…
  
  …and more possibility than any of us, on our own, could imagine. Which is why every year we come together—bringing the whole city into our fold.
  
  In 2016 we took a giant step in the direction of celebrating design broadly and inclusively, elevating design as built spaces, social impact, creative strategy, technology, craft, the arts and much more.
  
  This year, we’re in a full sprint. We’re working nonstop to ensure that every workshop, panel, studio tour, lecture and lunch event is curated to enhance community, connectivity, and diversity.
  
  Together with AIGA and our dedicated partners, we’re challenging ourselves and we’re challenging the world to see design—and the city in which we create it—differently.
  
  And to see that we’re closer together than ever before.
