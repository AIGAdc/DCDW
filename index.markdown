dc-design-header-text: DC is Design
dc-design-paragraph-1-text: Design is a driving force in DC. Whether supporting the
  nation’s leading nonprofits, engineering the next startup, or solving problems with
  real impact through our government, design is at the core of this city. We’re makers
  and disruptors, artisans and tech geeks, and this
dc-design-paragraph-2-text: October we’re coming together to celebrate. Join us for
  DC Design Week. This year we’re going bigger than ever with new partners, new venues,
  new event formats, and new ways to interact with DC’s unique design community. You
  won’t want to miss this.
