# DC Design Week

---

DC Design Week is led and produced by the local chapter of AIGA, the professional association for design. Every year, AIGA DC develops a week of fantastic programming—and every year, we strive to be more inclusive so that we can better reflect DC’s creative community as a whole. To accomplish this goal, we partner with organizations who share our values of community, connectivity, and diversity.
