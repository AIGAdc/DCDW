- name: Rhia Morsenberger
  title: Yoga Instructor and Belly Dance Artist
  bio: "Rhia is a yoga teacher turned movement educator, traditional Thai yoga practitioner,
    and professional dancer. Her work, in this lifetime, is to help people connect
    to a deeper part of themselves through movement. One of Rhia's foundational teaching
    points is that when you move more of your body, more often, in more different
    ways, and environments, it's guaranteed to change your quality of life & your
    relationship to life – often for the better. This mindset has led to a multi-disciplinary
    approach in her teaching – which often combines yoga with strength, joint conditioning,
    and somatic movement. Her intention is to create a safe place for people to have
    an embodied experience and a place for self-inquiry, resilience, and compassion
    to flourish. \n\nInstagram @rhia_dc"

Greet the day with a creative yoga practice at the Cheshire. Join your community for a short exploration of storytelling through movement, led by Cierra Jade. This dynamic introduction will be followed by a 45 minute yoga flow led by Kasia Galia and Rhia Morsenberger. After your flow, you’re free to head off to work or stay and join us for a special giveaway from Outdoor Voices, plus coffee and a light breakfast. 

Please bring your own mat for this session, as this event will be hosted in a creative arts space, not a traditional yoga studio.
