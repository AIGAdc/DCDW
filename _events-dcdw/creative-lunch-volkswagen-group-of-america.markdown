Join the [Volkswagen Group of America](http://www.volkswagengroupofamerica.com/about), which is the world’s largest car manufacturer, and their Digital UX team to learn how a history of user-centric car design and innovation helps transform digital experiences. Focused on creating experiences for those who have purchased a VW car, you’ll hear how this team designs experiences that allow drivers to control all of the features in their new electric car via an app or the web.

Parking is provided in the covered lot adjacent to the ManTech building.
 
Creative lunches are intimate gatherings that provide guests the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most exciting studios and spaces across the DMV. Expect to leave feeling inspired and full (lunch will be provided)!

Please plan to arrive 10 minutes early to allow time for registration and grabbing lunch. The presentation will begin promptly at 11:30am.
