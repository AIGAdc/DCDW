[Following Part 1](https://www.dcdesignweek.org/events/designing-with-archival-images-carnegie-library-part-1/) of a 2-part series, join us for this FREE event at the main stage of the Apple Carnegie Library. Leading this interactive workshop will be graphic designer Rachel Orr, who will guide attendees through her approach to collage art  using historical assets from the DC Historical Society. 

Sharing her involvement with #The100DayProject and giving attendees a look into how it inspired her creative process, you’ll then get hands-on with an iPad and Apple Pencil to experiment using layers of images, creating a colorful collage of your own!

Note: You don’t need to attend [Part 1](https://www.dcdesignweek.org/events/designing-with-archival-images-carnegie-library-part-1/) to join the fun of Part 2. But, if you’d like to learn more about the DC Historical Society and come to the Rachel Orr event with an entire set of royalty-free digital assets for your own personal use, be sure to sign up for Part 1 here.
