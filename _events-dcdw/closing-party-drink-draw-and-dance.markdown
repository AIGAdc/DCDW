  title: 
  bio: 'An artist who has distinguished herself as a musician through charismatic
    and witty vocals, smooth sounds, and unprecedented transitions between rapid-fire
    verse and an indie/acoustic vibe - Shalom started writing songs at 10 years old,
    learned to play guitar at 16, and hasn''t stopped mixing sounds since. As an artist
    and a student of the game she believes that visual art is a key complement to
    musical arts - from cover art to visualization of listener data; and as a creative
    who is very passionate about the intersections of music and business, she spends
    most of her time applying her entrepreneurial spirit in creative ways to propel
    her music. '

Exchange tales of an action-packed design week over a crisp glass of cider as we close out DC Design Week 2019! Our final event of the week takes place at Capitol Cider House, and you won’t want to miss it! Join us Friday night for one-part drink-and-draw and one-part live-music show (featuring performances by local musicians)! 

Drink locally-made cider and sketch in your notebooks while we meet the creative team behind the cidery’s branding and website. Come early and stay til we’re tapped out! There will be drinks and food available for purchase. 

This event is open to all skill levels whether you draw regularly, professionally, or just make the occasional doodle. We’ll provide plenty of drawing materials and custom DC Design Week coloring pages (if you don’t know coloring books are for adults too by now, we can’t help you). Plan to bring your own sketchbook and preferred drawing tools if you’re a pro or digital doodler! More into the drinking than the drawing side of this equation? All are welcome to join for the music, food and general good vibes!

Make sure to RSVP early – space is limited and tickets will be $20 at the door (until we sell out)! 

**Venue Accessibility:** On street level

**Transportation / Helpful Directions to Venue:** 4 min walk/0.2 miles from Georgia-Petworth Metro Station (yellow, green lines)
