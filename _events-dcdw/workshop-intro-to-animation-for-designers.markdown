From the UI on your favorite app to the introduction titles at the latest conference, motion graphics are just about everywhere. So if you’ve ever interacted with a seamless animation and thought to yourself, “I want to do that,” we expect to see you at this event!

Whether you’re a designer who wants to add a new skill set, or the mere thought of opening After Effects terrifies you, this event will provide the foundation you need to start animating your ideas to life.

Led by three motion graphics artists, this hands-on workshop include the following topics: 
* The 12 principles of motion
* Ideal software for motion graphics
* Transitioning from design to motion
* Pricing & pitch processes
* Frame-by-frame techniques
* Resources for further learning
* A full-length behind the scenes demo of DCDW animated assets

*Participants will be required to bring a laptop with Adobe After Effects already installed.* 

Does this event sound interesting to you, but perhaps too entry-level? We’ve got you covered. Check out the Expressions Workshop led by David Arbour, which will take place the same night.

## Event Partner: The Duke and the Duck
Founded in November of 2009, The Duke and the Duck has always been about one thing: telling good stories. Whether for education, entertainment, or inspiration, stories are at the core of our humanity. Our name deliberately evokes this age-old obsession with stories by sounding like a fable, The Duke & the Duck, but without coming with the baggage of an already existing tale.
