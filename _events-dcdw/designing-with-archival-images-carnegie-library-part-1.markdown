Heads up! This event is Part 1 of a 2-part series. Sign up for this session and then be sure to stick around for Workshop: DesignLab with Rachel Orr (Carnegie Library, Pt. 2)! (link to Rachel Orr event). 

Did you know there is a treasure trove of historical artifacts inside Carnegie Library? Weâ€™re talking diary entries, vintage ads, political posters and even the odd love letter. The Historical Society of Washington, D.C. is home to a vast collection of artifacts and materials from our cityâ€™s history. 

This workshop will orient local graphic artists and other creatives to the resources of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., and demonstrate how the  DC History Center is home to a vast collection of historic materials, now digitally available for use in your next artistic project!

Historical Society Librarians  Anne McDonough and Jessica Smith will lead a presentation and discussion on the use of various aspects of collections to inspire creative work. Discussion will include learning about artistsâ€™ needs as well as addressing digital assets request procedures, credit guidelines, copyright resources, and more.

**But wait, thereâ€™s more! Participants will become registered library patrons, have hands-on exposure to a selection of original artifacts, and following the workshop, will receive their choice of a set of royalty-free digital assets for use in creative works  ($125 value) ðŸ¤‘.**


PS. Immediately following this event, join Rachel Orr in a hands-on workshop in the main atrium at Apple (downstairs), where she will be leading a live-collaging demonstration using artifacts from the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. 

Please refrain from bringing any food or beverages to this event â€“ sorry, no snacks in the library!
