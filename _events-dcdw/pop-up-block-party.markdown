Be there when the Pop-Up pops off! 

The DCDW Pop-Up Shop is taking over Cherry Blossom Creative and The Neighborgoods and filling this amazing space with items made by your fellow makers and designers. Come and celebrate the DC design community at the Block Party and get first dibs on the awesome goods for sale at the Pop-Up Shop!

We’ll have official DCDW swag, cold beers, snacks, letterpress poster printing at the neighboring Typecase Industries, and the opportunity to put your money where the art is by supporting creativity sourced from the city we call home. 

Don’t miss it, because supplies won’t last!

## About DC Design Week
Built by 100% volunteer power, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of this community, hosted by AIGA DC. AIGA Member On-Sale begins 9/5 at 10:00am and the General Public On-Sale begins 9/10 at 10:00am.

100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the [Design Continuum Fund (DCF) ](https://www.givecontinuum.org/) scholarship fund. We believe in fostering the next generation of designers through helping local design-minded and underrepresented students as they pursue their education.
