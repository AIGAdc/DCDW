Be there when the Pop-Up pops off! 

The DCDW Pop-Up Shop is taking over Cherry Blossom Creative and The Neighborgoods and filling this amazing space with items made by your fellow makers and designers. Come and celebrate the DC design community at the Block Party and get first dibs on the awesome goods for sale at the Pop-Up Shop!

We’ll have official DCDW swag, cold beers, snacks, letterpress poster printing at the neighboring Typecase Industries, and the opportunity to put your money where the art is by supporting creativity sourced from the city we call home. 

Don’t miss it, because supplies won’t last!

In addition, they bring in a selection of home goods and gift products so you are sure to find something for everyone. If you get lucky you might catch their shop dog, Frankie, when he's on duty greeting customers and giving out free pets. The shop is open Tuesday - Saturday 12-8 and Sundays 11-7 at 2130 8th St. NW.
