HZDG combines creative branding and campaigns with data-driven strategy, social, and more to produce content that gives people a reason to listen and engage — connecting brands and audiences in innovative, meaningful ways. Join for a tour of their space and a peek into their world, from the creative process to thoughts about traditional advertising from their social design team. They’ll also showcase work they’ve done for some of the world’s leading brands.

Creative lunches are intimate gatherings that provide guests the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most exciting studios and spaces across the DMV. Expect to leave feeling inspired and full (lunch will be provided)!

Please plan to arrive 10 minutes early to allow time for registration and grabbing lunch. The presentation will begin promptly at 1:00pm.

## About DC Design Week

100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the [Design Continuum Fund (DCF) ](https://www.givecontinuum.org/) scholarship fund.
