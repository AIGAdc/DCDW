EAB partners with 1,400 schools, colleges, and universities to apply proven practices and help schools support students from enrollment to graduation and beyond. As a provider of research, enterprise technology, and data-enabled services for education institutions, EAB relies on design strategy to help make education smarter and communities stronger. Join us to learn more about their full-service, in-house creative department and how they take ideas from concept to creation.

Creative lunches are intimate gatherings that provide guests the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most exciting studios and spaces across the DMV. Expect to leave feeling inspired and full (lunch will be provided)!

Please plan to arrive 10 minutes early to allow time for registration and grabbing lunch. The presentation will begin promptly at 12:00pm. 

## About DC Design Week
Built by 100% volunteer power, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of this community, hosted by AIGA DC. AIGA Member On-Sale begins 9/05 at 10:00am and the General Public On-Sale begins 9/10 at 10:00am.

100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the [Design Continuum Fund (DCF) ](https://www.givecontinuum.org/) scholarship fund. We believe in fostering the next generation of designers through helping local design-minded and underrepresented students as they pursue their education.
