  title: Senior Product Designer at Spotify
  bio: Adriana Rivas grew up in the lush jungles of Costa Rica but exchanged the green
    for the baroque when she left to study Industrial Design in Italy. Today, she
    lives in the jungle that is NY and focuses on making tools for artists as a Senior
    Product Designer at Spotify. In the last 4 years, the team has grown from 40 to
    500 and the platform has evolved from an idea, to being an essential part of an
    artist’s career. Adriana has always had a passion for music – and finds it rewarding
    to be close to it every day and to solve problems for those creating it.
