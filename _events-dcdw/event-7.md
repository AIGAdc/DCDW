# Did he just throw my cat out of the window? 

## Yes, Yes, without the oops! Checkmate... Jaguar shark! 

### So tell me - does it really exist? 

#### Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? 

##### Here's my chance. I was part of something special. 

###### We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 

**'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!**

Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. I was part of something special. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Just my luck, no ice. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.

You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. What do they got in there? King Kong? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? What do they got in there? King Kong? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?

Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. You really think you can fly that thing? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. You really think you can fly that thing?

I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Must go faster. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? What do they got in there? King Kong? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? I was part of something special. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
