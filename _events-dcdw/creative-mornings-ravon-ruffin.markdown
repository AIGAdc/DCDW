Ravon Ruffin is a New York-based museum practitioner, community arts organizer, public arts educator, and digital strategist. She strives to make art + culture accessible for and by women and communities of color, both online and IRL.

She holds a Masters in American Studies from The George Washington University, and is an alumna of Virginia Commonwealth University, with a degree in Anthropology. It was during her time at VCU, that she realized the power of museums to be spaces for the future of community advocacy, education, and urban sustainability. In 2015, she co-created [Brown Girls Museum Blog](http://browngirlsmuseumblog.com/), in Washington, DC for the visibility of women of color cultural workers, artists, and creatives.

Currently, she is the co-founder and community manager at [Brown Art Ink](http://brownartink.com/). She was formerly a Digital Engagement Producer at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, on the WEBBY and SHORTY-award winning social and digital engagement team. In her spare time, Ravon is a proud mama to a pug named Winslow, and a houseplant addict. Ravon has been recognized by Adweek, The Washington Postâ€™s The Lily, and more.
