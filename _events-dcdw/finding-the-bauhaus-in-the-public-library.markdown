- name: Mira Azarm
  title: Innovation Instigator, UMD Academy for Innovation & Entrepreneurship
  bio: 'Mira Azarm is an Innovation Instigator in the Academy for Innovation & Entrepreneurship
    (AIE) at the University of Maryland. AIE is in the vanguard of reimagining higher
    education using human-centered design, and she is paid to provoke faculty, students
    and staff into becoming creative problem-solvers. If you’re familiar with institutions
    of higher education, you might think that’s about as exciting as watching paint
    dry, but actually, it’s like seeing mentos dropped into diet cola: the eruption
    is magnificent. She loves teaching folks at UMD how to build at low resolution,
    collaborate radically, let go of being experts and lean on others, and most of
    all, talk to each other in meaningful ways. In addition to teaching, she designs
    artifacts to communicate concepts and tools; partners with groups across campus
    to design new classes, curriculum, and workshops; and prototypes new ways to weave
    innovation into the cultural thread of the institutions she works in. Before joining
    the skunkworks that is AIE, she was a president of AIGA DC and a President’s Council
    Chair for AIGA, earned a M.A. in Social Design from the Maryland Institute College
    of Art, served as a Robert W. Deutsch Foundation Social Design Fellow. Currently,
    she teaches in the combined MA/MBA in Design Leadership program at MICA & Johns
    Hopkins Carey School of Business and serves on AIGA DC’s Advisory Board.'

  bio: 'Hazel Edwards is Professor and Chair of the Department of Architecture, College
    of Engineering and Architecture at Howard University since July 2016. Her unique
    career has combined place-related research with planning and urban design practice.
    Her research interests in quality of life are framed within urban design contexts
    while focused primarily on historic residential and campus environments. Her design
    background has served as a foundation for her talent for translating and representing
    ideas and concepts as well as creating alternatives. This orientation has a strong
    influence in all of her work-from campus planning; to master planning activities;
    to urban transportation studies; to qualitative and quantitative research; to
    pre-development services; to building-related projects; to community engagement;
    to proposal writing; to book design. Of note is a planning study that culminated
    in a book that she co-authored entitled, The Long Walk: The Placemaking Legacy
    of Howard University. Born in North Carolina, Dr. Edwards was raised in Washington,
    D.C. and holds a Bachelor of Architecture and a Master of Architecture in Urban
    Design from Howard University and a Ph.D. in Regional Planning from the University

Learn, Create, Collaborate—Bauhaus Style!

Finding the Bauhaus in the Public Library is a new public program series celebrating the 100th anniversary of the German Bauhaus school (1919-1933) and the modernization of D.C.'s own landmark, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library—designed by the last director of the Bauhaus, Mies van der Rohe.

During this DC Design Week event, you’ll learn how a radical design school influenced everything from the chairs we sit on to the architecture of buildings around the world. You’ll be free to create with makers of all kinds in the Library, and collaborate as we imagine how Bauhaus ideas of design, social purpose, and hands-on learning might serve our city today.

And if you walk away from this event wanting more, you can continue supporting the program series through exhibits, workshops, screenings and more at the Goethe-Institute, library locations, and other partner sites over the next year.

This event is presented by the DC Public Library, Goethe-Institut, Gensler, AIA | DC, AIGA, and additional partners. 

Please arrive 15 minutes prior to the start of the event! Tickets are not guaranteed, and if the event is full, we will begin distributing tickets to walk-ins at that time.

**5:30–7:00 p.m: Opening Reception for the Exhibition: Designing and Redesigning MLK Library **The MLK Library is a local icon: the only library ever built by Bauhaus architect Mies van der Rohe, and his only building in the District. Learn why the Library was almost torn down, how it was saved, and the reasons for the changes to one of D.C.’s most debated buildings, reopening in fall 2020. 

**7:00-8:30 p.m: Panel Discussion, Designing Utopia? Learning from the Bauhaus Experiment **
The Bauhaus (1919-1933) was a German art school that imagined a better world and launched some of the greatest architects, designers and artists of the 20th century—including Mies van der Rohe, architect of D.C.’s own MLK Library. Yet the school’s social vision was eclipsed by World War II and the rise of a fascist regime. Today we see traces of Bauhaus design everywhere—but what became of its utopian ideals? Further, what new perspective does this history offer on present-day challenges of inequality and shrinking public space? Join us for a cross-cultural conversation with experts from the fields of art and design, architecture, and education about historical experiments and today’s realities in design for the public good.

**Moderator:** Maryann James-Daley, Assistant Director of Public Services for the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library at DC Public Library
**Panelists:**
* Mira Azarm, Innovation Instigator, UMD Academy for Innovation & Entrepreneurship
* Hazel Edwards, Chair, Howard University Department of Architecture
* Karen Koehler, Professor of Art History, Hampshire College
