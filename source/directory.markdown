  body: "> DC is full of creators who craft art, jewelry, home goods, ceramics, cakes, stationery, clothing, and more. Whether for a living, as a side hustle, or as a hobby, these makers help power the creative energy in the DMV. We can’t do our normal DCDW Pop-Up Shop, but we’re still celebrating everyone who crafts and creates! 
  
  
  If you’re looking for a one-of-a-kind piece of art, something unique and shiny to wear, a special centerpiece, or even handmade gifts for the upcoming holidays — look no further than the DC Design Week Maker Directory to support your local creative community. Check out our list below for access to literally dozens of people making and selling amazing things, right here in our beloved city.
