      This year is a celebration of the creative voices in our community. We want to hear yours. We’re commissioning up to five designers to design an 11x17 poster that we’ll print and sell along with our DCDW 2020 merch at an online shop hosted by [To Be Determined]. 
      
      
      Posters should capture our [theme](#) for 2020: that DC is more than the politics we’re known for — that we know our home city and region to be more diverse, vibrant, and innovative than people could possibly imagine. Having a final design isn’t required to apply! In your application, include a link to your portfolio (or anywhere we can get a sense of your style). You’ll have plenty of time to execute your design if and when you’re selected.
      
      
      Each designer will receive $500 for their commission as well as 30% of all proceeds from sales of their design. Designers will be selected by a committee of volunteers, including Torie Partridge, Jodi Kostelnik, ABC, and XYZ. We’ll let you know if you’ve been selected by 8/6 Final designs must be submitted by 8/30.
