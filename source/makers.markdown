    > This year is a celebration of the creative voices in our community. We want to hear yours. We’re putting our money where our mouth is and commissioning custom poster designs from up to five emerging designers from the DMV. These 11x17” posters will be printed and available for sale (along with our DCDW 2020 merch!) at an online shop hosted by [Cherry Blossom Creative](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}.


    Posters should capture our theme for 2020: that DC is more than the politics we’re known for — that we know our home city and region to be more diverse, vibrant, and innovative than people could possibly imagine. Having a final design isn’t required to apply! In your application, include a link to your portfolio (or anywhere we can get a sense of your style) and a proposed concept for your poster. You’ll have plenty of time to execute your design if and when you’re selected. Applications are due Wednesday, July 29.


    Each artist will receive $500 for their commission as well as 60% of all proceeds from sales of their design. Artists will be selected by a committee of established artists, including [Dany Green](http://www.danygreen.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Sonia Jones](http://soniajonestheartist.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Jodi Kostelnik](https://theneighborgoods.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, and [Torie Partridge](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}. We’ll let you know if you’ve been selected by Tuesday, August 4. Final designs must be submitted by Wednesday, August 26.
