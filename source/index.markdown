          I'mma make a difference, I'm trying to make the thang that makes the difference
          Wait - let me explain
          You see it's bigger than the individual
          My armor stay invisible
          My efforts you can cite them in the pain
          (What's realer than that?)
          Got me feeling like the sentiment is of my own
          Keep calm carried on like a gentlemen
          But I'm in the arena, with hyenas
          And the only way to beat them, that I see is with intelligence
          (What's realer than that?)
          Being black with a brain
          They rather see me asking for the ball than for a raise
          Yeah I could dumb it down and get a buck
          Or smarten up and get the grave
          I'm just tryna make a living in the grade
          Try to fit me in the space
          I'll make you comfortable
          But I was sent to trouble you
          But when my calling finish, take the survey
          The pen is mightier than swords
          Only weapon that I got
          You're naive to think it's wordplay
          What's realer than that?
