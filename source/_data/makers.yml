  description-short: My approach is exploration all the time. But constantly wanting that exploration to lead to a positive place. I enjoy a lot starting over. So making mistakes (on paper) and going back to them is one of my favorite exercises. 
  description-long: I am from Nicaragua. In 2008, when I first went into business, the concept of an illustration store was never seen there. I was diagnosed with breast cancer the year before, so I guess I was very courageous after my brush with death, and decided to jump in, rent a place and start something new.

  description-short: I make everything by hand with clay. All of the designs I create are made through play and creativity. I get inspiration from color and basic shapes.
  description-long: I decided to go into business for myself because it’s also been a dream of mine to be a business owner. I always wanted to build something from the ground up that is mine. I wanted to show BIPOC that they can build, create, and be whatever they choose. It's a big statement to be a young black woman owning a business. I want others to be inspired and feel represented when they see my business.

  description-short: I spend a lot of time outside and am inspired by my favorite plants and animals, including one of my favorite subjects, bees! For my original paintings and custom pet portraits, I use acrylic paint on paper, canvasses, and wood slices. From my art, I create art prints, greeting cards, postcards, and stickers.
  description-long: I find so much joy in creating pieces that inspire people and remind them to enjoy and find beauty in nature, and in being able to capture pets in a way that their owners will cherish forever.

  description-short: I create watercolors that are designed as a mix and match series of food related art prints. From cocktail recipes and bacon, to blueberries and blue crab, there's something for everybody. In addition to the prints, I offer greeting cards featuring my art, and my illustrated cookbooks that celebrate recipes from my travels. My newest project is Small Batch — a collection of recipes and stories from foodies in the DMV.
