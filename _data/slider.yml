      DC’s been mixing, remixing, and adding a funkier beat since Chuck Brown kept his fans on the dance floors for hours in the 60s and 70s. In the 80s, the city even re-used its snowmobiles for mobile stages to provide free go-go concerts all summer!

      The Nine may be the last word, but if you want to settle things with a little three-on-three there’s an even higher court. Literally. On the top floor of the Supreme Court is the *[actual highest court](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highest-court-of-the-land){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}* in the land.
