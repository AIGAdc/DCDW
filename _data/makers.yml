  description-short: My approach is exploration all the time. But constantly wanting that exploration to lead to a positive place. I enjoy a lot starting over. So making mistakes (on paper) and going back to them is one of my favorite exercises. 
  description-long: I am from Nicaragua. In 2008, when I first went into business, the concept of an illustration store was never seen there. I was diagnosed with breast cancer the year before, so I guess I was very courageous after my brush with death, and decided to jump in, rent a place and start something new.

  description-short: I make everything by hand with clay. All of the designs I create are made through play and creativity. I get inspiration from color and basic shapes.
  description-long: I decided to go into business for myself because it’s also been a dream of mine to be a business owner. I always wanted to build something from the ground up that is mine. I wanted to show BIPOC that they can build, create, and be whatever they choose. It's a big statement to be a young black woman owning a business. I want others to be inspired and feel represented when they see my business.

  description-short: I work in watercolor because of its unpredictable flow. Using a dynamic medium to depict snapshots in time, be it a place I traveled or creating a portrait of a beloved pet, forces quick decision making to create a painting. This lets me focus on the composition and create a feeling of a place or whatever my subject is. Seeing a familiar scene in a new way can ignite a fond memory or have the viewer notice something they never did before. I attempt to bring these perceptions to life and try to expose something new about them to my audience.

# I am a baker who specializes in unique cake flavors such as blood orange, bourbon brown sugar, etc. My approach to baking and designing cakes is to find unique ingredients to create an unforgettable taste experience! Baking is a science and each ingredient plays an important role and has the ability to alter the end product. I always stay true to my process and procedure so that I get consistent and delicious results. I love working hard each day to create cakes that will be enjoyed at some of life’s most important events!

# I create with a semi-impressionist style with soft edges and a lighter application of oils than is standard. While most of my art is inspired from real settings or imagery, the end result is an intentionally painterly rendering.

# A fascination with object design was the source of inspiration for me in the early 1990’s when I began creating hand built, small mixed media sculptures that could be mounted on a wall.  Each of these artworks include select found objects which add interest to my work through their unique shapes, colors, and textures.

# My work is very storytelling-oriented. It is inspired by cartography, gender, sensuality, transcendentalism. I make prints, murals and comics that are about spaces in the real world, but also about what it means to exist in a physical body and navigate physical spaces not built for you.


# I tend to oscillate between bouncy and broody, and will champion all that is handmade and hand-drawn.

# Designer, illustrator, puckish rogue. I have many monikers. I like clean lines and strong elements. Words like sophisticated, elegant, heavenly may apply to my work not all the time but it's what I strive for. When I'm not creating the goods, I'm gazing into the distance "meta".


# My illustrative work is usually pop-oriented, where I remix old aesthetics and fuse them with a comic/anime feel. Design-wise I focus on identity creation and branding.
