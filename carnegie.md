# Sundays at Carnegie

---

Built in 1903, the Carnegie Library has stood in the center of a changing city for more than a century. Since re-opening its doors in May of 2019, Apple has reimagined this historical landmark, transforming its halls into a public space dedicated to creativity, technology and community.

In the two Sundays leading up to DCDW & the first Sunday during DCDW, **Apple and AIGA DC are partnering to host a series of talks with DC artists at the Apple Carnegie Library.** During these sessions, each artist will discuss their craft with the audience and — with the help of Apple products — give attendees the opportunity to interact with their medium firsthand. If you’re interested in illustration, zines, industrial design, or collage-art, you don’t want to miss out.

Join us for these exciting events located at [Apple Carnegie Library on 801 K St NW](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Apple+Carnegie+Library,+801+K+St+NW,+Washington,+DC+20001/@38.9026329,-77.0250803,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b7d4a02debff:0x56873e602430863b!2m2!1d-77.0229695!2d38.9025102){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
