sponsors-header: Want to Sponsor DCDW2019?
sponsors-body: '"Did you know that 2018 was the biggest DCDW yet, with 9 days of back-to-back
  programming in all 4 quadrants of DC, MD & VA!? That was only possible because of
  the generous support of our sponsors. This year, we’re looking to make DCDW2019
  even better — more events, in more places, featuring even more aspects of DC’s curious
  and creative community. But we can’t do it alone (though we’d certainly try). We’re
  currently looking for partners who can help make the best DCDW a reality. Whether
  you’re able to offer space, offer in-kind services, or offer financial support,
  your contribution will make the difference. Click below to support #DCDesignWeek
  and be part of the excitement as an ally of the creative community."
