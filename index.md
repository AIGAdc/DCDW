dc-design-paragraph-text: |-
  In the nation’s capital, design is all around us. From our architecture to our activism, from our technology solutions to our craft cocktails, the DMV is created and recreated by design everyday. We’re not a swamp. We’re more intentional than that.

  We are your government problem-solvers, your startup go-getters, your nonprofit champions. We are makers and changers, artisans and engineers. We’re celebrating together, and you’re invited.

  We can’t wait to show you what we have in store for this year’s DC Design Week. New partners, new venues, new formats, same commitment to the people and the work that makes this city great (because some things just shouldn’t be disrupted). Are you ready?
