  Design is for thinkers and doers, listeners and seers, go-getters and problem-solvers. It’s for walkers, bikers, drivers, and Metro riders. It’s for writers and readers, game players and web creators, food lovers and museum-goers. It’s for makers and appreciators, and it’s always up for debaters.

  Design: it’s a people thing. And in the DMV, we’re home to some of the smartest, coolest, realest, and greatest people around—not to mention one of the most exciting and innovative design cultures in the world.
