  Design is a people thing. That's why last year, DC Design Week explored
  the theme Design is for All, which took a closer look at how design shapes our communityâ€”along with the people who get to do the shaping. The result? 37 events including animation workshops, a creativity-boosting guided meditation, letterpress printing, screenprinting, a run around the murals, a talk about designing for voice UI, and so, so, so much more.

  Thank you to everyone who came out and represented this wonderful creative
  community of ours.
