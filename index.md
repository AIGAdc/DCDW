  Design is a people thing. That's why last year, DC Design Week explored
  the theme Design is for All, which took a closer look at how design shapes our community—along with the people who get to do the shaping. The result? 37 events including animation workshops, a creativity-boosting guided meditation, letterpress printing, screenprinting, a run around the murals, a talk about designing for voice UI, and so, so, so much more.

  Thank you to everyone who came out and represented this wonderful creative
  community of ours.

sponsors-header: Want to Sponsor DCDW2019?
sponsors-body: |
  Did you know that 2018 was the biggest DCDW yet, with 9 days of back-to-back programming in all 4 quadrants of DC, MD & VA!? That was only possible because of the generous support of our sponsors. This year, we’re looking to make DCDW2019 even better — more events, in more places, featuring even more aspects of DC’s curious and creative community. But we can’t do it alone (though we’d certainly try). We’re currently looking for partners who can help make the best DCDW a reality. Whether you’re able to offer space, offer in-kind services, or offer financial support, your contribution will make the difference. Click below to support #DCDesignWeek and be part of the excitement as an ally of the creative community.
