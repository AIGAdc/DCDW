DC Design Week is produced by AIGA DC, a volunteer-run, 501(3)c nonprofit organization, in concert with a consortium of local associations, meetup groups and small businesses.

We rely on the generosity and goodness of others to make this week of celebration a reality. Major thanks to the following partners and sponsors for your support and commitment to the DC design community.

We couldn’t do it without you!
