  In addition to this year's events and outreach, we're opening our very first DCDW Pop-Up Shop & "Get Out the Vote" Gallery. Thanks to our friends at [Cherry Blossom Creative](http://cherryblossomcreative.com/), [Washington Project for the Arts](https://www.wpadc.org/), and[ Typecase Industries](http://www.typecaseindustries.com/) for making this happen. The shop and gallery are open all week and will serve as headquarters for DCDW.

  We're taking over the Cherry Blossom Creative storefront and
  filling it with items made by locals. Swing by, shop, and support our neighborhood
  maker and creative community. Have something to add to the shop? Hit us up and
  lets make it happen! [tj@aigadc.org](mailto:tj@aigadc.org)
