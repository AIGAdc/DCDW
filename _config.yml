  text: |-
    Built by 100% volunteer power, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of this community, hosted by AIGA DC. AIGA Member On-Sale begins 9/5 at 10:00am and the General Public On-Sale begins 9/10 at 10:00am. 100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the [Design Continuum Fund (DCF) ](https://www.givecontinuum.org/)  scholarship fund. We believe in fostering the next generation of designers through helping local design-minded and underrepresented students as they pursue their education.

  description-short: My approach is exploration all the time. But constantly wanting
    that exploration to lead to a positive place. I enjoy a lot starting over. So
    making mistakes (on paper) and going back to them is one of my favorite exercises.
  description-long: I am from Nicaragua. In 2008, when I first went into business,
    the concept of an illustration store was never seen there. I was diagnosed with
    breast cancer the year before, so I guess I was very courageous after my brush
    with death, and decided to jump in, rent a place and start something new.

    plants and animals, including one of my favorite subjects, bees! For my original

  description-short: I work in watercolor because of its unpredictable flow. Using
    a dynamic medium to depict snapshots in time, be it a place I traveled or creating
    a portrait of a beloved pet, forces quick decision making to create a painting.
    This lets me focus on the composition and create a feeling of a place or whatever
    my subject is. Seeing a familiar scene in a new way can ignite a fond memory or
    have the viewer notice something they never did before. I attempt to bring these
    perceptions to life and try to expose something new about them to my audience.

    all occasion cards, and novelty items. I use various mediums and techniques to
    create socially relevant and uplifting artworks; mediums often used are watercolor,
    markers, and graphite pencil.

    We are a group of young artists with multidisciplinary backgrounds, promoting black artists and celebrating the black and brown experience through art. We are painters, illustrators, videographers, graphic designers, animators, and street-wear designers. We sell paintings, prints, apparel, keychains and more.


    5ive Creatives started as a group of long-term friends who met in a local art program. Through the program we became great friends and have always inspired each other's art.

    My work is very storytelling-oriented. It is inspired by cartography, gender, sensuality, transcendentalism. I make prints, murals and comics that are about spaces in the real world, but also about what it means to exist in a physical body and navigate physical spaces not built for you.


    I tend to oscillate between bouncy and broody, and will champion all that is handmade and hand-drawn.

    Designer, illustrator, puckish rogue. I have many monikers. I like clean lines and strong elements. Words like sophisticated, elegant, heavenly may apply to my work not all the time but it's what I strive for. When I'm not creating the goods, I'm gazing into the distance "meta".


    My illustrative work is usually pop-oriented, where I remix old aesthetics and fuse them with a comic/anime feel. Design-wise I focus on identity creation and branding.

    through traditional and digital mediums. With every piece I create, whether through
    illustration, comics or sketches, I aim to understand myself and the people around
    me more than when I began the piece.
