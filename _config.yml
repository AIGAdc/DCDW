  header: "About DC Design Week"
  text: |-
    Built by 100% volunteer power, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of this community, hosted by AIGA DC. AIGA Member On-Sale begins 9/5 at 10:00am and the General Public On-Sale begins 9/10 at 10:00am. 100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the [Design Continuum Fund (DCF) ](https://www.givecontinuum.org/)  scholarship fund. We believe in fostering the next generation of designers through helping local design-minded and underrepresented students as they pursue their education.
