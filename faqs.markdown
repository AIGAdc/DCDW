    ### [Verse 1]



    You wear the face of strength
    The armor of a tank
    Keep ya' calm in a bomber's brink
    Your eyes are another paint
    I seen their true colors through your blinks
    Thin out I'm not here to exploit your chinks
    More to reinforce 'em, from the forces sent to see you sink
    Stay afloat, and stay a while, and take a break
    All you hear is orders barking, brick
    And mortar stopping walls and space
    What a shame becoming blame of roots, and no escape
    Closing gates on fate like all mistakes are born in place
    All it takes is pressing forth with form and grace
    Forge a bond with more than hate
    Meet these words with open arms
    And plant your feet the planet shakes
