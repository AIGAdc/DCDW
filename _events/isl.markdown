  name: Zach Goodwin
  title: Executive Creative Director
  bio-text: 'Zach Goodwin is ISL’s Executive Creative Director. He leads an eclectic,
    multidisciplinary creative team that effortlessly crosses mediums in pursuit of
    powerful brand experiences. As a partner and ISL’s founding creative, Zach has
    shaped the work and the voice of agency since 2008. Campaigns that straddle the
    digital-and-physical world, like his work for NBC Universal’s Mr Robot, Miller
    Coors’ Redd’s Apple Ale or Volkswagen’s #PinkBeetle have drawn attention — and
    a few Cannes lions along the way. Zach also directs content and commercials, leading
    ISL in-house production team called ISL Studios. In the last year, he has directed
    commercials for Volkswagen, Dannon Danimals, Dannon Oikos and 19 Crimes.'

Join ISL's Zach Goodwin and Maggie Winters Gaudaen for a behind-the-scenes look at the long, arduous and (occasionally) rewarding process of taking a commercial from concept to screen. We'll walk through the essential steps of a well-planned production — and share some suggestions for creating film content worth watching on a DC budget.
