UNLEADED is a space for creative & innovative individuals who are passionate about using design to make a positive impact. We meet once a month to learn from experts and use design sprints to solve real problems as we connect with our DC community.

In part 2 of a 2 part series, Create& CEO Gabriel Arteaga will host a conversation based on his trip around the country, engaging with communities in response to difference and constructing responses while grappling with bias.
