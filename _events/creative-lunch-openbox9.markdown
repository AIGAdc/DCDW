[Join AIGA for Early Access + Discounts.](http://dc.aiga.org/membership/membership-rates/)

Join us for a lunch-time discussion about the challenges and unique opportunities we often encounter designing for the nonprofit world. We'll use a case study to explore this topic and also talk about how design can be used to effectively further a cause.
