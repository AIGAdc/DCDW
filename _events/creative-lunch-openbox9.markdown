Please plan to arrive 10 minutes early to allow time for registration and grabbing lunch. **The presentation will begin promptly at 12:00 PM.**

Join us for a lunch-time discussion about the challenges and unique opportunities we often encounter designing for the nonprofit world. We'll use a case study to explore this topic and also talk about how design can be used to effectively further a cause.
