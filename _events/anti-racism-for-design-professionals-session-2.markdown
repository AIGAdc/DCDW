Being anti-racist calls for us to support a radical reordering of society to achieve political, economic, and social equality. As designers, we must ask ourselves: what role can we play to ensure our work isn’t just not racist, but is actively anti-racist? Join Dr. Enid Montague for a hands-on discussion about practicing design with anti-racist principles at the forefront — both how we change the way we do our work as well as the work we do. Dr. Montague will give a short talk and guide a meaningful conversation about how to cultivate anti-racist principles in our own design work.
