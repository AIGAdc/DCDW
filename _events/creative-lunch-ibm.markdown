The IBM Studios Washington DC is the 44th entrant to the IBM Studios global network of outcomes-focused studios that allow design and co-creation to thrive. Studios bring value to IBM by driving and amplifying design-led business outcomes for IBM's offerings and services, accelerate sales cycles and help IBMers close more impactful deals.

Studios provide repeatable experiences for clients & whole teams, share best practices across industries and create global communities. They are places where we help our clients imagine & create the future through collaboration, co-creation, rapid iteration, tinkering and prototyping. We make to think.

## In our DC studio you’ll find IBM iX and IBM Design

**IBM iX**, your global business design partner. We work at the intersection of strategy, creativity, and technology to help our clients digitally reinvent their businesses. IBM iX is progressive creative consultancy, a truly modern business partner designed to help clients create advantage in a rapidly changing world.

**IBM Design:**
Great brands differentiate themselves through the design of their products and services. When IBM Design was established in 2012, we began a journey to transform how IBM conceives, builds and delivers products and services to our users around the world. We want to elevate human experience as the principal benchmark; users - not raw technology or buyers - are now our North Star.

In our time together you’ll learn about IBM iX and IBM Design and how we’re working at the intersection of design, business, and technology for the public sector. We’ll share with you one of  our exciting emerging technology explorations and how being human centered is leading our work.

Lunch is included. Registration is $10, limited to 25 attendees. Priority registration for AIGA members opens at 9am on October 2nd. General registration opens at noon on October 4th. Grab a spot at the beginning of the registration line, and sign up to become a member today!

Please plan to arrive at IBM 10 minutes early to allow time for registration, lunch and swapping stories with other designers. The presentation will begin promptly promptly at 12:00 PM.

Nearest Metro stop is at McPherson Square and Metro Center. If driving, there is parking at 1401 G St N. Once you are in the building, you’ll need to check in at the WeWork front desk, get a badge, and they’ll send you up to the 8th floor to the front desk. At the front desk, one of our IBMers will escort you to the studio.
