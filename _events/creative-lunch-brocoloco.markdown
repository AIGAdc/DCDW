Please plan to arrive 10 minutes early to allow time for registration and grabbing lunch. **The presentation will begin promptly at 12:00 PM.**

BroCoLoco is a design firm that specializes in art installations and murals for commercial and community spaces. Founded and directed by Aaron Scales and co-run with Cassie Scales, the studio works with architects, interior designers, and business owners to transform buildings and shape brand identities.

Attendees can expect to be inspired to embrace the challenges and advantages of designing in the District as we discuss the trending intersection between art, advertising and architecture. You’ll get a peek behind the scenes of the BroCoLoco studio and how Aaron’s unusual perspective as architect and embassy designer merged with DC’s unique urban environment to create a vehicle for transforming buildings and influencing day-to-day experience in the city. Lunch will be provided!

Creative lunches are intimate gatherings that provide guests the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most exciting studios and spaces across the DMV. Expect to leave feeling inspired and full.
