  pronouns: She | Her | Hers
  title: Photographer
  bio: 'Originally from the Southside of Chicago, Dana Scruggs has been living and
    working in New York for the past 7 years. In 2016 she launched SCRUGGS Magazine,
    a print publication dedicated to her vision of the male form. The magazine was
    a way for her to create editorial and creative content because none of the magazines
    that she approached would hire her. She wrote and photographed all of the content
    herself and the seminal issue became more akin to her visual diary and personal
    manifesto. In the spring of  2018, after self assigning for almost six years -
    Dana was offered the opportunity to shoot ESPN''s Body Issue, which was her first
    major breakthrough in the industry.  Synonymously Dana then became the first Black
    female photographer to shoot an athlete for The Body Issue in its 10-year history.
    Dana broke down even more barriers when, in November of 2018,  she became the
    first Black Person to photograph the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine in its 50-year
    history. '

The need for diversity in photography goes beyond the subject — it includes the artist behind the lens. Why? Because photographers and subjects alike affect what we capture and how we tell that story. Who is behind the lens affects the final photograph as much as who or what is in front of the lense.

Join us for a panel of young POC photographers, photojournalists, artists, and creative leaders who will share their experiences in the industry and how their respective backgrounds shaped the work they’ve done. We’ll also discuss the progress and the work that lies ahead in making the photography industry — and every creative medium — more diverse and inclusive.
