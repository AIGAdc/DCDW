Join us for a unique gathering with interdisciplinary artist and healer Artis Moon, at Take 5 Meditation, Washington, D.C.'s premiere meditation only studio in Dupont Circle. Come explore the connection between consciousness and creativity.

A guided meditation with sound bath and suggested meditation techniques and visualizations to 'try at home' for inspiration or creative breakthroughs will be offered.

Journaling, visualization, energetic release, and aura cleansing, facilitated by the healing sounds and vibrations of wooden flute, drums, rattles, and crystal and metal singing bowls will gently guide you on a journey home to your Self.

Bring water and a journal if you wish. No experience necessary!

What can I expect?
R&R!!!!!! Wind down after a long week to cultivate space for you.
