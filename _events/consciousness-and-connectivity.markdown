**Dwell is in the Red Brick Carriage House in Trinidad Alley off of the 1200 block of Florida Ave NE & Trinidad Ave NE, 20002 Washington, United States**

Join us for a unique gathering with interdisciplinary artist and healer [Artis Moon](https://www.instagram.com/theboundlesslife/), at [Dwell](https://www.instagram.com/dwelldc/), a privately owned, off-grid (yes, in DC!), untethered creative space. Explore the connection between consciousness, meditation practices, and creativity.

Participants will delve into deep meditation, breathwork, journaling, visualization, energetic release and aura cleansing, with facilitation by the healing sounds and vibrations of a wooden flute, drums, rattles, crystal singing bowls, and chimes. Our goal is to help you take a moment to reflect while gently guiding you on a journey home to your inner self.

Afterwards, mingle with us while you enjoy a catered, organic dinner and cocktails on the roof. 

## What can I expect?

This is a 21+ event and casual attire is encouraged. An invitation to enjoy cannabis in a creative and intentional way will exist but there is no obligation to partake. 

We ask participants to bring water, a blanket, and a journal if you wish. However, we’ll also have some just in case. No prior meditation experience is necessary.

## Will refreshments be provided?


Yes. A light buffet of healthy dinner time options, water, and a fresca will also be provided. Post-meditation rooftop cocktails are also included.
