It’s Crafternoon: Time to get your stitch on.

This is a hands-on, beginner-friendly workshop led by designer and illustrator, Jo Zhu. Learn how to interpret images through embroidery and practice applying stitches and textures to create illustrative compositions. No previous experience is necessary — and families are encouraged to attend. This will be a fun and creative way to spend the afternoon!

Make sure you’re fully stocked on thread and supplies before the event kicks off! Here’s a list of supplies you’ll need:
* A plain T-shirt (new/used)
* Sewing needle
* Floss (DMC 6 Strand Cotton Floss recommended, patterns and colors will provide later)
* Water or heat soluble fabric pen (use it to draw patterns on t-shirts) 
* Hand embroidery hoop (optional, but it makes stitching on fabric easier) 
* Scissors
