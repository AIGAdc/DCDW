  bio: The Washington Post hailed Broke Royals’ new full-length as "an album of pristine
    pop-rock.” In addition, Broke Royals were recently crowned the "best band in DC"
    by Parklife DC and named as the DC-area “Artist on the Rise” by Southwest Airlines.
    Over the last five years, Broke Royals have earned these accolades through countless
    electrifying performances and their signature blend of pop hooks and premium rock
    & roll. CBS News called them one of “Best Up-And-Coming D.C. Bands to See this
    Year.”

Watch DC-based rock band Broke Royals in their DCDW, special edition episode of their weekly livestream series “Alone, Together,” where they write, record, debut, and dissect a brand new song every week! This week’s song will be written using this year’s DCDW theme “Your Creative Voices” in mind. They are joined by fellow DC musician Will Eastman, a DJ and the owner of U Street Music Hall.

With this session, Broke Royals wants to encourage collaboration and community in this time of social distancing. Band members will share tips for how to stay creative under a strict deadline.
