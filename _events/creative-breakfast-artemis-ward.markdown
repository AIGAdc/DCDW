Start your Tuesday off right and join us for a creative breakfast with Artemis Ward! You may know them from their digital work for NatGeo or DC United — but the team at Artemis Ward is also committed to supporting DC’s creative community. Staff at the studio help lead a number of local initiatives, including Creative Mornings DC and Little Salon.

Joel Daly, Danielle McKenrick, and Chris Maier will give you an inside look at what it’s like to work at this creative digital agency. Learn about their culture and process, their approach to creative work, and how they make space to build and support our local community. And as you eat your bagel and drink your coffee, there will be plenty of time for conversation, questions, and networking.
