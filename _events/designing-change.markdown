There’s no question about it. Black and Brown designers make a daily impact on creative industries, including design. Yet AIGA’s 2019 Design Census showed only 11% of those surveyed identified as African American or Hispanic.

This begs the question: How can we improve diversity in design? This is a challenge we must address within the design fields in general, which is crucial for making progress in the DMV.

Join our panel of senior Black and Brown creatives to learn:
* How they navigate their careers in design
* How they work to diversify their industry
* How to support POC designers in the workplace and our community

Participants will get to hear directly from our speakers, moderated by Maurice Cherry – host of the Revision Path podcast – about these topics and more, and will split up into breakouts for an intimate, in-depth exploration. Make sure to select what topic you’d like to explore further when registering and come prepared for a critically important conversation.
