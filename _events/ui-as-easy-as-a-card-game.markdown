Evaluating UI may not be as easy as 1-2-3, but it can be as easy as a card game.

Jason Brier, a Purdue and Amazon alumni, will help elevate your UI evaluation skills with a deck of cards that synthesize 100 years of research on perception, cognition, and ergonomics. Learn how to detect and resolve costly UI problems early in development.

For this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn with and from other participants. We’ll provide a digital version of the cards, explain how to use them, conduct engaging group activities, and conclude with a Q&A. This is a hands-on workshop, where you’ll get to learn with and from other participants in engaging activities.
