ISTUDIO Architects is a small, DC based firm passionate about designing spaces that promote healthy communities and sustainability.  The creative lunch will be hosted at Marvin Gaye Recreation Center, one of ISTUDIO’s most recently completed projects.  We will use Marvin Gaye Rec as a precedent study for three different design strategies:

1. Turning project challenges into opportunities
1. The importance of the initial site analysis and research, and how this can be used to inform the final design
1. How incorporating artwork can be integrated into the design itself, rather than being an additive item after project completion.

More information on the project can be found on our [website](https://istudioarchitects.com/portfolio/marvin-gaye-recreation-center).
 
Marvin Gaye Rec is 1 block from the Capitol Heights Station.  Please come to the main entrance of the building, off of 61st Street NE.

Lunch will be provided. If you have any allergies, please note them in your registration and we will do our best to accommodate.
