Tech Lady Hackathon was started to get more women and non-binary individuals into tech. Each year in D.C. hundreds gather for a day of friendly learning and hacking. Coders, tech strategists, newbies, nerds, and the curious are all welcome!

Training: Training and mentoring workshops will be offered all day.

Some examples of classes: Intro to... APIs, Python, GitHub, html/CSS, and data viz.

Discussion Groups: There are guided discussion groups throughout the day for more specific Tech Lady communities, such as Women of Color in Tech, Government Tech, and Mid-Level in Tech.

Hackathon: This is a civic hackathon, but participants are welcome to bring anything and pitch it.
