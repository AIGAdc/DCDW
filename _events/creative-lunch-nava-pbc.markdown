Nava works with agencies to build more human-centered government services. Nava was formed by a team of designers and engineers that were brought in to help fix HealthCare.gov in the winter of 2013; since then Nava has expanded to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. As a public benefit corporation, Nava cares deeply about its mission, and has helped millions enroll in healthcare, improved policy, removed redundant forms, and saved the government millions of dollars. More recently, Nava has partnered with Code for America to improve the social safety net at the state level, and worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to release design.cms.gov, an accessible design system for government websites.

**Lunch is included.** Registration is $10, limited to 25 attendees. Priority registration for AIGA members opens at 9am on October 2nd. General registration opens at noon on October 4th. Grab a spot at the beginning of the registration line, and sign up to become a member today!

Please plan to arrive at NAVA PBC 10 minutes early to allow time for registration, lunch and swapping stories with other designers. The presentation will begin promptly promptly at 12:00 PM.

The address is 1428 U St NW, Washington, DC 20009. Nearest Metro stop is U Street. If driving, there is street parking.
