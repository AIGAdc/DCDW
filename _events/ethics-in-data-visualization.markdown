  bio: Andrew Ba Tran is a data reporter on the rapid-response investigative team
    at the Washington Post. Andrew has analyzed how COVID-19 has disparately impacted
    certain communities, the spread of opioids across the country, and the rise of
    right-wing violence. He shared in winning the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative
    Reporting in 2018 for the coverage of candidate Roy Moore's alleged past sexual
    harassment of teenage girls and subsequent efforts to undermine the journalism
    that exposed it. Andrew was a data editor at The Connecticut Mirror's TrendCT.org.
    Prior to that, he was a data producer at The Boston Globe and he's worked in newsrooms
    of The Virginian-Pilot and the Sun-Sentinel. He’s a graduate of the University
    of Texas and teaches data journalism at American University. Andrew is an advocate
    for open data and reproducible research.

    Post. Armand joined The Post in 2017 as a graphics reporter, where he worked on

    served as the foundation for The Afghanistan Papers, and an interactive “tour”
    of the U.S.-Mexico border. Prior to joining The Post, Armand worked at the Los
    Angeles Times, where he worked on the data desk and was briefly the deputy director
    of data visualization. Armand earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations

Current events coupled with an upcoming presidential election mean we’ve seen data visualization everywhere, from news outlets to personal social media accounts. Data visualization can help us make sense of complex information — but it can just as easily tell only one part of a story.

In this discussion, data reporter Andrew Tran and graphics assignment editor Armand Emamdjomeh, both from The Washington Post, will share their experience with creating and presenting data through design. You'll learn about best practices that help ensure data is ethically and accurately displayed and how to avoid the misrepresentation of data and the story it tells.
