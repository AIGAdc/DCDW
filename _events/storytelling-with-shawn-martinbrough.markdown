You’ve heard of T’Challa, Captain America, Hellboy, Luke Cage and Batman, right?

(I mean, of course.)

Get ready to meet Shawn Martinbrough, the renowned illustrator and artist who helped bring these characters – and more –  to life. In addition to illustrating these iconic heroes, Shawn has written and spoken about how inclusive storytelling — those stories that feature diverse voices and characters — can change perceptions. 

Did we mention he’s doing all this from the DMV?

In this keynote, Shawn will share what it’s like to work in the comics industry drawing these legends and explore the importance of diversity and representation both in pop culture and in the industries that produce the content we consume.
