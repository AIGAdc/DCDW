Data visualization. The term may sound boring and jargony – seriously, try saying it 10 times fast – but the meaning is simple and the concept important. Data viz is the art of creating a visual representation of data to identify trends and patterns.

In this workshop – which is perfect for beginners – you will learn how:

* To explore the impact of design on data.

* To define and design data while telling stories.

* To expand your critical thinking skills when consuming data-driven visuals and broaden the way you think about complex issues.

* Bias impacts the way we design and how to be inclusive.

And more!

Don’t worry if you’re new to data viz or have lots of questions! This workshop, led by Christina Animashaun from Vox, is designed to be highly engaging and interactive — there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and chat with your peers.
