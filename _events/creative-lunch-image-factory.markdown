## Creating Trailers
In this event we will showcase the art of cutting a trailer for non-fiction programming for major television networks. A well cut and crafted trailer can spark an audience's imagination, hinting at the plot, style, and tone. An engaging trailer can drive engagement and help spike ratings and tune-in. 

We will take attendees thru case studies from past and current projects. We will show you the end to end process of cutting a successful trailer for TV, Film or streaming. Topics we will cover: Writing copy, editing, color correction, title card design/animation, sound design and finishing. Attendees will leave with a overall grasp of what it takes to create a compelling trailer for their non fiction projects. Industry terminology and basic production steps.
