During this Creative Lunch, attendees can expect a tour of NASA’s Conceptual Image Lab and a presentation on the work they do animating NASA’s science themes. The Science Visualization Studio will also give a presentation in the NCCS Dr. Piers J. Sellers Data Visualization Theater on their work in the Science Visualization Studio. Presentations will be followed by Q&A.

Located in Greenbelt Maryland at the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, our artists work closely with the world's leading astronomers, scientists and engineers to bring theory, design and concepts to life in a scientifically accurate and visually compelling way. 

Guests are asked to meet at the [Goddard Visitors Center parking lot](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/visitor/directions/index.html) by 11:30 to allow time for necessary security screenings prior to the event’s prompt start at noon. 

## About NASA’s Conceptual Image Lab
NASA's Conceptual Image Lab has been creating award-winning animations, visual effects and design, applying its creative skills across all four of NASA's science themes: Heliophysics, Astrophysics, Earth Science and Planetary. 
CI Lab artists blend art and science together using a wide range of materials, techniques and software, to meet the challenges of developing all phases of production to create animations designed to educate and entertain. 

## About The Scientific Visualization Studio
The Scientific Visualization Studio wants you to learn about NASA programs through visualization. The SVS works closely with scientists in the creation of visualizations, animations, and images in order to promote a greater understanding of Earth and Space Science research activities at NASA and within the academic research community supported by NASA.
