In association with American Red Cross and National Cartoonists Society, Washington, DC area cartoonists have clotted together to help keep the local blood banks well-stocked.

All blood donors receive a complimentary cartoon sketch by a Washington, DC area cartoonist.

Walk-ins are also welcome on October 20. Halloween costumes are encouraged, but not required.

On the day of donation, donors are asked to:

Cartoonists scheduled to participate are Steve Artley, Carolyn Belefski, Eric Gordon, and Joe Sutliff.
