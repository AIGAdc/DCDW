It’s no secret. Many local governments were – and still are – unprepared to handle COVID-19. With issues like unemployment, proper testing, and overcapacity in hospitals, pro bono work is crucial for helping our communities thrive. That’s where designers come in. Using your experience, you can create meaningful tools that improve the relationship between citizens and government and creates a lasting impact. 

Figuring out how to get involved — where to start, what skills you need, and more — can be one of the hardest steps. We’re here to help make you get started doing good. Join us for a conversation Nicole Kwoh, who will share real-world tips from the US Digital Response team on how to get involved in the civic tech space, work with local governments, and thrive as a pro bono designer.
