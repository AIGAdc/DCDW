As creatives, we tend to stay in the deep end of our craft and discipline. But sometimes, the best way we can help ourselves (and our work) is to step away so that we can recharge ourselves and come back with a new sense of inspiration and invigoration. Join us at Nh.D Studio to start the day right—with coffee, conversation, and wellness in mind!

## Coffee & Design
Coffee & Design is a collective of emerging designers in the DMV founded by Phim Her and Katya Sovich. It started as an informal talk series, introducing emerging designers to senior creatives, with the intention of learning about their creative processes and insights about the profession. It has since developed into an experimental platform where young and senior professionals can meet, connect, learn and share their experiences. We host creative meetups, speaker series, and experimental workshops, based on the creed that “knowledge crowns those who seek her.
