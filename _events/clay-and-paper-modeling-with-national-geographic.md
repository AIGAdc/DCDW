## The Artist
### Fernando Baptista | Senior Graphics Editor for National Geographic
The Spanish-born artist developed and defined his graphic skills at El Correo in Spain. Upon moving to America, Baptista accepted a position at National Geographic as Senior Graphics Editor. This position gives Baptista a platform to freely experiment with a varying number of mediums and collaborators, including sculpture. The two-time, Emmy-nominated artist has also won the Peter Sullivan Award — sometimes referred to as “The Pulitzer Prize” for infographics — from Malofiej.
