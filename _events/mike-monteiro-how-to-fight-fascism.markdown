description: All design is political, because all politics are designed. The world
  is a mess because a certain set of people designed it to be a mess. Now we need
  a different set of people to design our way out of it. This is not a choice. Regardless
  of whether this is what we wanted or not fascism is knocking on our front door.
  This is how we knock back.

Mike Monteiro (yes, that Mike Monteiro) has a brand-new talk—How to Fight Fascism—and you're invited! Monteiro is the co-founder and design director of Mule Design, an interactive studio whose work has been called “delightfully hostile” by The New Yorker. His 2014 talk “How Designers Destroyed the World”, about the intersection of design and social responsibility, was awarded 2014 Talk of the Year by Net Magazine.

All design is political, because all politics are designed. The world is a mess because a certain set of people designed it to be a mess. Now we need a different set of people to design our way out of it. This is not a choice. Regardless of whether this is what we wanted or not fascism is knocking on our front door. This is how we knock back.
