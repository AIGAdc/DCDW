  description: "This event aims to share the many perspectives of experienced leaders
    within our design community. On the panel will be speakers who represent a demographic
    that may have gone through a career transition or retirement, and would contribute
    towards a discussion about the many lessons they’ve learned or changes they’ve
    witnessed as they’ve artfully managed to evolve with the times. Our moderator,
    Dan Banks, will serve to draw out commonalities and new perspectives that connect
    with an audience of all ages, and even more so, help to translate a renewed sense
    of belonging with the design industry at-large. The panel is anticipated to be
    about an hour long following a Q&A informal discussion. \n\n## Dan Banks (moderator)\n\nDan
    Banks has been designing and art directing in the DC area for over 25 years, starting

    designer and is committed to building and maintaining great client relationships,
