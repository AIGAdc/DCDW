    it to a client. Creating a compelling story from a list of recommendations is
    an often overlooked design skill.

The myth that good design sells itself is just that — a myth. Good solutions aren’t always obvious at first glance. Good ideas, even the best ideas, need to be sold. A designer who can do pretty good work and persuade the client it’s right, is worth more than a designer who does amazing work, but can’t sell it to a client. Creating a compelling story from a list of recommendations is an often overlooked design skill.

Making your case makes it more likely your work will launch on time (or at all) and that it represents your true intentions. It’s smart business.

During this workshop, we’ll cover effective presentation techniques including: how to take charge of a room, how to turn your research and data into a good story, how to map your work to the objectives of your business or client, how to ask for the right kind of feedback, and more importantly, how to avoid getting feedback you don’t really need!

**What are people saying about this workshop?**

"The content was incredibly useful. I've mostly worked as a lone wolf in a sea of engineers and have been making it up as I go. Having some solid, easy to remember, principles for not messing up have already carried me through the last week of a pretty challenging project."

"It was a revelation."

"I don't know how to choose just one favorite part."

**Who is this workshop for?**

You. No, seriously—you. Whether you’re a designer, a developer, an engineer, a content strategist, or whatever funny name you’ve come up for yourself this week, your job includes having to convince someone of something. This is true whether you’re working in an agency, a studio, inside an organization, or for yourself. Everyone has clients, even if you call them “boss”.

**What should I bring?**

Be ready to give a 5 minute presentation of something you have done recently. It doesn't matter what you bring (but make sure your boss is okay with other people viewing it.)

**Are there discounts if I bring my team to the workshop?**

Yes, there is a discount on regular priced registration if you enroll four or more people. Please contact us at [workshops@muledesign.com](mailto:workshops@muledesign.com) for more information.

**Is my registration transferable?**

If you cannot attend, you may receive a full refund up to 30 days before the workshop. You can also transfer your registration to anyone you like at any time. Please contact us at [workshops@muledesign.com](mailto:workshops@muledesign.com) if you have questions.

**I can't make this workshop. Will there be more in the future?**

Yes! Email [workshops@muledesign.com](mailto:workshops@muledesign.com) to be notified when our next workshops are scheduled. We can also come to you!

**Who is leading the workshop?**

[Mike Monteiro](http://twitter.com/monteiro) is the co-founder and design director of Mule Design, an interactive studio whose work has been called “delightfully hostile” by The New Yorker. His 2014 talk “How Designers Destroyed the World”, about the intersection of design and social responsibility, was awarded 2014 Talk of the Year by Net Magazine.
