There's become a higher demand for animated content, and a lot of it is being filled with motion graphics animation. As a designer, you can create the assets and the art direction, but where do you begin with making it move? This will be a short intro crash course on animation that is geared towards designers who are looking to grow their skills. 

Intro to Animation for Graphic Designers will cover the principles of animation, tips for prepping designs for animation, a small hands on workshop making traditional flip books to practice the skills that you learn, and additional resources for software + continued learning. 

## The Instructor [@hannamations](https://www.instagram.com/hannamations/)
Hannah Churn is an animator and illustrator located in Washington D.C. Currently sheâ€™s using her right side of the brain for The Duke & The Duck. When not creating art, Hannah is, creating art. She runs a comic called Palindrome and is an avid doodler of cats. Her and her husband also run a side shop called Art Churn where they sell their artwork at comic conventions.

## The Duke & The Duck [@dukeandtheduck](https://www.instagram.com/dukeandtheduck/)
Founded in November of 2009, [The Duke & the Duck](http://www.dukeduck.com) has always been about one thing: telling good stories. Whether for education, entertainment, or inspiration, stories are at the core of our humanity. Our name deliberately evokes this age-old obsession with stories by sounding like a fable, The Duke & the Duck, but without coming with the baggage of an already existing tale.
