Are you an old pro with Sketch design software, or are you just getting the hang of it? Either way, we've got you covered! In collaboration with Sketch and General Assembly, we're hosting workshops covering both beginner and advanced-level Sketch users. Join us and get your sketch on!

**Beginner Course:** We're covering the basics from crafting your wireframes and mockups to exporting them in a smart way.

**Advanced Course:** This workshop will focus on the ability to collaborate with your teammates in the most effective way including new tools introduced in Sketch 47.
