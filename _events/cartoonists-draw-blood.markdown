In association with American Red Cross and National Cartoonists Society, Washington, DC area cartoonists have clotted together to help keep the local blood banks well-stocked. All blood donors receive a complimentary cartoon sketch by a Washington, DC area cartoonist.

* On the day of donation, donors are asked to:
  drink plenty of fluids

* bring a list of medications they are taking and a photo ID
