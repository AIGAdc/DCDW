Jomo Tariku is a local industrial designer who has participated in shows internationally showcasing Contemporary African Furniture design. He has participated in international Design Week in Dubai, UAE and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Milan—as well as had shows in Lagos, Accra, Venice most recently in Milan at the Salone del Mobile 2018. 

Jomo's furniture incorporates a deep appreciation for African art and culture and infuses his heritage into contemporary product designs such as chairs and tables, and other home furnishings to offer an alternative to current styles and trends and believes the market is ripe for disruption.

This will be an intimate conversation about what it is like being an industrial designer, the importance of bringing African inspired designs into the industry without the assumed narratives, and following/making passions happen in real time (i.e. how he manages to keep track of everything he is working on while still being internationally involved at shows). 

AIGA DC Salons are intimate roundtable discussions where we can talk, share and learn with each other. It’s where the creative community can have in-depth conversations and connect with people that have similar interests, all before your work day begins.
