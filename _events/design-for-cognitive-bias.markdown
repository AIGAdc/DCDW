Users take shortcuts to get through the day. (Don’t we all?) Usually, they’re harmless. Sometimes they’re helpful. But what happens when they’re not?

In this talk, David Thomas, creator and host of the Cognitive Bias Podcast, will use real-world examples to identify adverse biases that often lead users to make bad decisions. But not all is doom and gloom. We’ll discuss content strategy and design choices we can leverage in our apps, designs, and platforms to redirect or eliminate the impact of those biases. We’ll also explore our own biases as designers and some methods to prevent our own blind spots from hurting users — and have a chance to dig in on your questions.

In addition to getting to join in for an exciting discussion, all participants will receive a code for a free digital copy of David’s newest book, *Design for Cognitive Bias* from DCDW sponsor **A Book Apart**, to help you put what you’ve learned into practice.
