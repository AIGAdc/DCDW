Grab some water and tune in to sweat out the stress with a wildly fun, all-levels dance cardio class hosted by and8 Fitness.

This class is designed to give you an intense, full-body workout while celebrating our bodies and what they can do. Expect full-on fun, sweat-drenching moves, wild energy, and a power playlist of hip hop, (t)rap, and a dash of Top 40 hits. (Think Megan, Normani, Lizzo, and Kendrick.)

Founders Danielle and Dominique Gillyard will lead you through the “...5, 6, 7, and8” of this 60-minute class (45 mins of dance cardio, 15 mins of stretching and conversation). The final 15 mins will focus on stretching while Danielle and Dominique share about their experience launching a creative business and designing choreography.

Not a great dancer? Have no fear. This isn’t about how you look. It’s about how you feel.
