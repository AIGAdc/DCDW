## Free Event!

Get ready to lace up your sneakers and join us for a mural run of DC’s most exciting street art. Washington DC has a history of great artists who transformed the sometimes overlooked spaces with their colourful works of art. Join Jules DeVita and Matt Green  ([District Running Club](http://www.districtrunningcollective.com/)) as they traverse DC’s historic neighbourhoods to see best and of the brightest best urban creative art in the district. Whether you’re a beginner, or an experienced marathoner, all paces and abilities are welcome.

The total distance of the Mural Run will be 3 miles. The goal is to maintain a conversational running pace (talking & smiling all the way!). We will stop briefly at each mural to take a group picture and to appreciate the artwork!
