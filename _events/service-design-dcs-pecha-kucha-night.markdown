As part of DC Design Week, Service Design DC — home of the Service Design Network (SDN) DC chapter — will be hosting our second installment of five Pecha Kucha presentations, this time centered around the theme “Celebrating the voices of DC’s creative community.” Join us for an evening of Service Design inspiration.

If you haven’t experienced Pecha Kucha before, you’re in for a treat! Pecha Kucha presentations are 20 slides that auto-advance every 20 seconds - and clock in at exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds each. Our selected speakers are going to regale us on service design-related case studies, methods, frameworks, and perspectives from various sectors ranging from government, commercial, and non-profit. 

We’ll be sure to pepper in some time for introductions and networking as well, keeping the total event time around an hour and a half. (Zoom fatigue is real!)
