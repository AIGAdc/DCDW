Join Emory Douglas, the ex-Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, in a discussion on the intersection of Design and Activism.
Emory Douglas became politically involved at the age of 24 as Revolutionary Artist and then Minister of Culture for the Black Panther party. Mr. Douglas' powerful images portrayed through the party's newspapers, posters and pamphlets spoke to social injustices experienced by black and other oppressed people in the U.S. and around the world. While his works often address issues of race, they also exude empowerment in the face of poverty, discrimination, and imperialism.
Emory Douglas was born May 24, 1943, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He has been a resident of the San Francisco, California Bay Area since 1951. Douglas attended City College of San Francisco where he majored in commercial art. He was politically involved as Revolutionary Artist and then Minister of Culture for the Black Panther party from February 1967 until the early 1980s. Douglas' art and design concepts were always seen on the front and back pages of the Black Panther Newspaper, reflecting the politics of the Black Panther Party and the concerns of the community.
This talk is brought to you by a partnership between AIGA Baltimore, AIGA DC, and Bowie State University.
