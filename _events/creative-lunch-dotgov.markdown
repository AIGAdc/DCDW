Do you report to a manager who isn't a designer? Feel like you're the only creative person in your organization? Hear from designers in government who have been successful getting buy-in from leadership about the importance of design. You'll leave with tactics for how to successfully pitch projects and communicate with managers who may not be creative professionals.
