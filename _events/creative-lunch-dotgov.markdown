Do you report to a manager who isn't a designer? Feel like you're the only creative person in your organization? Hear from designers in government who have been successful getting buy-in from leadership about the importance of design. You'll leave with tactics for how to successfully pitch projects and communicate with managers who may not be creative professionals.

Creative lunches are intimate gatherings that provide guests the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most exciting studios and spaces across the DMV. Expect to leave feeling inspired and full (lunch will be provided)!
