Squash and stretch. Staging. Slow in and slow out. Arc. Any of that sound familiar? No? You might want to register for this animation workshop!

Get ready to make some moves and learn about the 12 principles of animation with LAI Video’s creative director Tiffany Lewis and art director Rob Kramer. They’ll walk you through the basics, how to apply these principles in After Effects, and how to create an animation based on art direction. This is the perfect hands-on workshop for anyone looking to add motion to their skillset— you’ll get to practice along with other participants and talk through questions and challenges with the instructors.

Initial project files will be distributed to participants. The project files will contain an initial setup that participants can edit along with the presenters if they so choose.

Speakers will provide:
• Illustrator and After Effects projects beforehand for the demos
• A handout with helpful keyboard shortcuts, expressions, and the list of continued learning resources
