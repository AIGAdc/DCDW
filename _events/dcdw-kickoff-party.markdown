### Tickets Available October 4 at 9am! 

This event is free but tickets are required. 

We're blasting off the week with a beer + burgers shindig at Wet Dog Tavern in Shaw.

It'll be one-part celebration of the amazing work produced at the (un)hackathon earlier in the day, and one-part community mingling to officially kick off DC Design Week 2017.

We'll have burgers built by acclaimed Chef Elias Tadese. Just ask anyone who had this man's burgers at last year's closing party. They are...the bomb.

Come early and stay til we're tapped out!
