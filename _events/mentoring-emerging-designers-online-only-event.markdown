Higher education on its own is rarely enough to provide emerging designers with the confidence and resources to jump-start their career dreams. Behind every successful designer, there is a story about a mentor or teacher that had a major impact on their design journey. At this digital event, viewers will learn about the value, demands, and rewards of mentoring from a panel of professionals. Attendees will also hear how participating as a mentor or mentee can benefit anyone at any stage of their career. 

## Panelists 
**Donnisha Beverly**, Senior Visual Information Specialist, Internal Revenue Service
**Mikea Hugely**, Founder/Creative Director, CRE8T1V3
**Gary Rozanc**, Assistant Professor of Graphic Design, University of Maryland, Baltimore County

## Moderator
**Mira Azarm**, Innovation Instigator, UMD Academy for Innovation and Entrepreneurship

This event is presented by the AIGA DC Design Continuum Fund, a scholarship initiative for talented, underrepresented students pursuing creative careers in the area. AIGA DC supports emerging designers not only by providing financial assistance, but also by building an inclusive community where they feel welcomed and supported. Be part of the effort and join the community.
