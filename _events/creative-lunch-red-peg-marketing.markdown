  description: RedPeg is an independent brand engagement agency that creates experiences
    that delight, inspire, and instantly make an impact. Through insight-led strategy,
    they ensure that fleeting moments become long-lasting memories; and that these
    memories resonate with our clients and their audiences — clients such as GEICO,
    Amazon, Jägermeister, NBCUniversal, and Carlsberg. They get the need for measurable
    ROI and KPIs, and for upward curves in sales and social numbers. They achieve
    those, while also remaining focused on creating experiences that leave lasting
    impressions. It’s simple, really. They make it mean more, and have been since
    1995.
