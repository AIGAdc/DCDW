## Calling All Makers!
Hear from local designers creating their own furniture, letterpress prints, jewelry, ceramics, activist art and more! Panelists will examine the influence the DMV has had on their work and discuss how they’ve used design to impact their community and beyond.
 
## Pyramid Atlantic Print Demo
Print your own limited edition posters, including a two-color letterpress poster designed by DCDW’s 2018 featured artist: [LA Johnson](http://www.thelajohnson.com/)!

### [Franc Rosario](http://francrosario.com/)
Francisco Rosario's 15 year photography career included shoots with The Wu-Tang Clan and a 5 year stint working for the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. An autodidact ever interested in a new creative adventure, Francisco transitioned from photography into wood and then metal fabrication-initially motivated to make objects like those he was being exposed to but could not afford. His most recent work is focused on space specific design of furniture and tools for individual artists and creative spaces including Pyramid Atlantic Arts Center and the Japanese Information and Cultural Center. In his playtime, Francisco works on geometric wood and metal sculpture exploring space and place.

### [Val Lucas](https://shop.bowerbox.com/)
Val Lucas, a graduate of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), runs Bowerbox Press, a letterpress and woodcut printing studio in rural Monkton, Maryland. She is inspired by the natural world and landscapes, wildlife and farm animals, and the history of letterpress printing. By combining the age-old traditions of hand-set metal and wood type with woodcut images, she creates prints, posters and cards that reflect her diverse interests.
