Please plan to arrive 10 minutes early to allow time for registration and grabbing lunch. **The presentation will begin promptly at 12:00 PM.**

Design doesn’t simply make things look pretty or cool. It makes people actually feel something that motivates them to take action. Really think about it: Can you create a successful customer experience without design? Sometimes it comes down to rolling up your sleeves and designing beyond the computer and bringing dimension to a project that exceeds surface level interest. Bates Creative is diving into analog design during this Creative Lunch and sharing a first look at how some of its favorite beyond-the-computer designs came to be. 

So, maybe you’re the designated doodler on your team, or the textile fanatic who brings texture to your work. That’s the magic we’re talking about. The Bates Creative design team wants fellow designers to know that your creativity shouldn’t be confined to a computer. 

Come step into our brand-new studio in the heart of downtown Silver Spring and learn how creativity moves across all devices, media and places. We’re rolling out the proverbial welcome mat to all creatives—or a massive mural at the entrance to our studio in this case—to celebrate talent that cannot be digitized: creativity, imagination, intuition, ethics and emotional intelligence.

## Parking
You have your pick of parking garages and street parking to choose from. The closest garage is the Wayne Avenue Garage and is only a two-minute walk to our studio.

## Metro
We’re a short walk from the Silver Spring Station on the Red line.
