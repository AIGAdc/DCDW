## New Rules

The world is changing fast. Often so fast that we don’t take the time to think about what kind of society and future we actually want to build. Politics has become disconnected from fact. Innovation is pursued without consideration of ethics. Around the world, we are building walls instead of bridges.

New Rules asks:

* How can we be more empathetic when we design for the future?

* How can we reconnect policy with facts, truth, and logic?

* What ethics should we pursue as we shape our rapidly changing world?

The answers are elusive—but we become stronger when we ask these questions together. What are the New Rules that will help guide us for the next century?
