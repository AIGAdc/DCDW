# Pop Up Shop

<hr class="title-divider-blue">

In addition to this year's events, we're opening our yearly DCDW Pop-Up Shop. We're taking over the [Cherry Blossom Creative](http://cherryblossomcreative.com/) storefront and filling it with items made by locals. Swing by, shop, and support our neighborhood
maker and creative community.

**Wed, Oct 26 — Sun, Oct 29 from noon to 8pm @ Cherry Blossom Creative
2128 8th St NW, Washington, DC 20001**

We will throw a [low-key launch party](http://www.dcdesignweek.org/events/pop-up-shop-launch.html) on Thursday, Oct 26. Come hang out, drink beverages and meet the artists featuring work in the shop.
