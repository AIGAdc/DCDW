# Pop Up Shop
---
The DCDW Pop Up Shop is back and it’s bigger than ever. This year, we’re taking over THREE storefronts in Shaw. That’s right. Every shelf, table and flat surface in [Cherry Blossom Creative](http://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/), [The Neighborgoods](https://theneighborgoods.com/) AND [Typecase Industries](http://www.typecaseindustries.com/) will be stocked with items made by DC locals. Swing by, shop, and support your neighborhood maker and creative community (during business hours, please).
