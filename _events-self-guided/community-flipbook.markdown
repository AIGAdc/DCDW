With a virtual DC Design Week, we’re going to miss seeing all of you IRL. So we’ve planned the next best thing: a virtual community flipbook featuring all of you!

All week-long, we invite all of you to use a template and create a portrait of yourself. Once you have made your creation and submitted it via this Google Form, we’ll reveal an animation of our community portraits as our favorite file format ever: a GIF.
