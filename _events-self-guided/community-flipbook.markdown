With a virtual DC Design Week, we’re going to miss seeing all of you IRL. So we’ve planned the next best thing: a virtual community flipbook featuring all of you!

All week-long, we invite all of you to use a template and create a portrait of yourself. Once you have made your creation and submitted it via this Google Form, we’ll reveal an animation of our community portraits as our favorite file format ever: a GIF. [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19i0IatgUJPbbgK0UvVXZ6AiZS3xstqz_oyCSCuVTBQc/edit?usp=sharing_eil&ts=5f36cef4&urp=gmail_link)
