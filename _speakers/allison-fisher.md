Allison Fisher is a designer and letterpress printer from Baltimore, Maryland. She is the manager of the Globe Collection and Press at MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art). She fell in love with printmaking and letterpress while earning her BFA in Graphic Design at MICA. As a student she was bitten by the DayGlo love of Globe and devoted most of her senior year helping to rally student support for acquisition of the collection. Her love of Globe kept her in Baltimore, lurking around MICA’s campus, helping on projects and spreading the word of Globe until MICA finally hired her. Allison manages all things related to Globe at MICA from the production of Globe’s new projects for clients like Hello Kitty, Smithsonian Institutions and Stax Records, to wrangling Globe interns, overseeing archiving, working on community-oriented projects and more. When not working on Globe Allison can be found tinkering on her own presses and working as a Linotype apprentice at the Baltimore Museum of the Industry.
