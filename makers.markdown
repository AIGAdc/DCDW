    This year is a celebration of the creative voices in our community. We’re putting our money where our mouth is and commissioning custom poster designs from up to five emerging designers from the DMV. These 11x17" posters will be printed and available for sale (along with our DCDW 2020 merch!) at an online shop hosted by [Cherry Blossom Creative <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}.

    Posters will capture our theme for 2020: that DC is more than the politics we’re known for — that we know our home city and region to be more diverse, vibrant, and innovative than people could possibly imagine.

    Each artist will receive $500 for their commission as well as 60% of all proceeds from sales of their design. Artists will be selected by a committee of established artists — [Dany Green <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://www.danygreen.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Sonia Jones <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://soniajonestheartist.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Jodi Kostelnik <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://theneighborgoods.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Josue Martinez <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://corintogallery.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, and [Torie Partridge <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}.

    > DC is full of creators like you who craft art, jewelry, home goods, ceramics, furniture, chocolate, cakes, stationery, leather goods, clothing, buttons, and more. Whether you do this for a living, as a side hustle, or as a hobby, we see you. We’re thrilled you’re part of the creative energy in the DMV.


    We want DC Design Week to celebrate you too. In September, we’ll be launching a directory of makers to help folks in our region (and around the world?!) find awesome people doing awesome things. Whether you have an online shop or brick-and-mortar, we want to show the world the amazing things you make.
