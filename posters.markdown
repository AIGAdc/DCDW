    body: "> This year is a celebration of the creative voices in our community. We’re so excited to feature 5 limited-edition posters. Created by 5 up-and-coming artists in the DMV, these designs capture the diverse, vibrant, and innovative spirit of DC. The artists were selected from a pool of 65 applicants by an amazing committee of established artists — [Dany Green](http://www.danygreen.com/), [Sonia Jones](http://soniajonestheartist.com/), [Jodi Kostelnik](https://theneighborgoods.com/), [Josue Martinez](https://corintogallery.com/), and [Torie Partridge](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/).
    
    
    These 11x17” posters are available for purchase at an online shop hosted by [Cherry Blossom Creative](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/). Read on for details about the artists and their work."
