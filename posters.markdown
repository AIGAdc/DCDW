    > This year is a celebration of the creative voices in our community. We’re so excited to feature 5 limited-edition posters. Created by 5 up-and-coming artists in the DMV, these designs capture the diverse, vibrant, and innovative spirit of DC. The artists were selected from a pool of 65 applicants by an amazing committee of established artists — [Dany Green <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://www.danygreen.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Sonia Jones <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://soniajonestheartist.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Jodi Kostelnik <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://theneighborgoods.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, [Josue Martinez <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://corintogallery.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}, and [Torie Partridge <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}.

    These 11x17” posters (printed right here in DC at [BaseCamp <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://www.basecampdc.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}) are available for $20 each, or as a set of postcards for $10, at an online shop hosted by [Cherry Blossom Creative <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}. Each artist received a $500 commission and will be getting 60% of all proceeds from sales of their design. Don’t miss out on this limited time opportunity to show your DC pride—order yours today!
