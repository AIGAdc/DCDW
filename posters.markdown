    body: '> This year is a celebration of the creative voices in our community. We’re so excited to feature 5 limited-edition posters. Created by 5 up-and-coming artists in the DMV, these designs capture the diverse, vibrant, and innovative spirit of DC. The artists were selected from a pool of 65 applicants by an amazing committee of established artists — [Dany Green <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://www.danygreen.com/), [Sonia Jones <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](http://soniajonestheartist.com/), [Jodi Kostelnik <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://theneighborgoods.com/), [Josue Martine <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>z](https://corintogallery.com/), and [Torie Partridge <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i>](https://www.cherryblossomworkshop.com/).
